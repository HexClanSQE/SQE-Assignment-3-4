In meeting 2:

We finalize the open source project to explore.
Till now  we decide to  work on two projects one is
Kubernetes  and the second is Saleor.

Kubernetes automates operational tasks of container management and includes built-in commands 
for deploying applications, rolling out changes to your applications, scaling your 
applications up and down to fit changing needs, 
monitoring your applications, and moreâ€”making it easier to manage applications.

Saleor's open-source platform is free to use in its full version. It has clean and simple code written 
in Python and JavaScript on a Django framework, with a GraphQL API. You can find out everything you 
need to know about the technology base of Saleor from our developer documentation.


We discussed different aspect of these projects  and also  we divided the tasks.
Hmaza is exploring the architecture part and junaid is exploring task2.
while Hira is exploring the non-functional requirements of the project.
